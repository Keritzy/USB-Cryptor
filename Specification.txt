Textfile Encryptor Specification
-------------------------------------------
Use Python 3...
	- hopefully able to pack the whole script into an executable
	- No retarded python terminal...

Encrypts/Decrypts ASCII-formatted textfiles

2 factor authentication
	- 1x 6-digit key (# of digit subject to changes)
	- 1x USB device 
		- use Vendor & Product ID (VID,PID)

GUI!!!
	- Decided to stick w/ Tkinter since I'm quite familiar w/ it already
	- Flat design (subject to changes)
	- As simple as possible, too many features will confuse new users
	- Strong emphasis on UX, easy to navigate + dummy proof
